# Task 1: Dataset Understanding

✔ Loaded the dataset successfully using pandas.
✔ Displayed the first 10 rows to get an overview of customer data.
✔ Identified the data types of each column:
  - Most are object or integer types.
  - Noticed that 'TotalCharges' is of object type instead of numeric.
✔ Checked for missing values:
  - No direct missing values reported, but 'TotalCharges' might contain blanks.

⚠️ Notes:
- Will need to handle 'TotalCharges' during Task 2 (Data Cleaning).
- No obvious data issues, but will standardize column names later.
