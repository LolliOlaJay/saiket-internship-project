âœ” Grouped customers into 3 tenure segments:
  - 0â€“12 months
  - 13â€“36 months
  - 37+ months

âœ” Visualized customer count per group using a donut chart.

âœ” Added annotations to highlight differences in average spend.

ðŸ“Œ Observations:
- [e.g. Customers with 37+ months tenure tend to pay less on average.]
- [e.g. Majority of customers fall in 0â€“12 month group.]
